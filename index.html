  <p>Mindful eating is about enjoying your food fully, recognizing hunger and fullness, and appreciating the nourishment
    meals provide. It encourages eating slowly, without distraction, and listening to your body's needs. This practice
    can enhance digestion, satisfaction, and lead to a healthier relationship with food.</p>
